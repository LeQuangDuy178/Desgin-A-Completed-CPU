Design and Verification of A Completed CPU

1/ Introduction to the project
In this project, the simple design of a CPU module, running in a RISC architecture is conducted and its implementation and configuration is verified through the Hardware Description Language (HDL). Indeed, the design and verification of the CPU is described through the System Verilog HDL, developed in the Quartus Prime Lite software for code editing and synthesis, and the Modelsim software for running simulation and waveform observation. The devices family used for running and simulating the project is Cyclone-V.

2/ Brief Instruction set of the CPU
The CPU developed in this project is much simplier than the outside marketable CPU system, as it is scaled to the RISC architecture, and its execution is done through manual inputing the intruction, rather than the automatic process of fetch-execute cycle as usual. Generally, the operation of the entire system is shown as below image:
